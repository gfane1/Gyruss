Priority list - High Todos work
ok please read the differences.md file and make a todo list of the High Priority differences between the HTML/JS version of the game and the Gotdot version of the game. Then prepare a list to address each of the issues to carry out in steps one by one please.
At the very end of that task list...please update the differences.md file with the updates made to those items please.

Priority list Critical Todos work
ok please read the differences.md file and make a todo list of the Critical Priority differences between the HTML/JS version of the game and the Gotdot version of the game. Then prepare a list to address each of the issues to carry out in steps one by one please.
At the very end of that task list...please update the differences.md file with the updates made to those items please.
After that I'll test to see if things are working before we work through High, Medium and Low issues

TWO CODE BASE PROMPT - MEGA UPDATE

ok please review copilot-instructions.md and changes I've made to the folder structure. Basically the Original HTML Javascript version of the Gyruss game is in the "gyruss-html-js" folder and it works pretty well, thgough there are still a few things that need to be fixed.
The "gyruss-godot" folder hold a port of the html js version to the gotdot game engine, that version is much faster...but has many issues. First I'd like you to review the entire code base starting with the  "gyruss-html-js" and then reviewing the "gyruss-godot" files...Please then:

1) update the copilot-instructions.md
2) create a new root level \Gyruss README.md file that explains everything including a runnint the VS Code Live Server to test the JavaScript HTML version and the Download and basic steps to set the gotdot version of the game. 
3) Create two sets of ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md, CODING-GUIDELINES.md files appropriate for both code bases and place them inside the  "gyruss-html-js" and "gyruss-godot". Make sure these are referanced directly in the copilot-instructions.md file depending on which project codebase the request relates to. It is very important these files are specific to each project. 
4) Update the copilot-instructions.md file again to insure this is in place.

---TOO BIG

5) Create two detailed design.md files that explain all of the UI funtion functions and exactly how the game works, in great detail, even including special effects and ship sprites one for the "gyruss-html-js" and one for the "gyruss-godot" implementation, and place these in their relevant directories.

6) Compare the "gyruss-html-js" design.md document to the "gyruss-godot" version and produce a differences.md document at the root node that expains all the missing things from the  "gyruss-html-js" to the "gyruss-godot", there are many missing features and game asthetics that I'd like to fix up in the "gyruss-godot"
Finally break this into individual tasks and steps and then keep implemting them. without me needing to oversight you every time...happy if this task runs for ages in the background making changes

_______________________

SUGGESTED BREAK 2

5) For the `gyruss-html-js` implementation, create a concise `design.md` file in the `gyruss-html-js` folder.

   - Focus on high-level structure, not every individual function.
   - Include the following sections only:
     1. Overview of the game
     2. Core game loop and main update flow
     3. Player controls and movement
     4. Enemy spawning and wave logic
     5. Scoring, lives, and game states
     6. Visual effects and audio (brief summary only)
   - Use short paragraphs or bullet points.
   - Keep the whole file under 300 lines.

6) For the `gyruss-godot` implementation, create a similar `design.md` file in the `gyruss-godot` folder.

   - Use the same section headings as in the HTML/JS design document.
   - Explain how each part is implemented in Godot (nodes, scenes, scripts).
   - Focus on the main systems and data flow, not every helper function.
   - Keep the whole file under 300 lines.

7) Create a `differences.md` file at the repository root that compares the two implementations.

   - Summarise only the important differences in behaviour, features, and visuals.
   - Include a short table with columns like: "Feature", "HTML/JS", "Godot", "Notes".
   - Highlight missing or degraded features in the Godot version that should be improved later.
   - Keep this file under 250 lines.


_______________________

SUGGESTED 2 PHASE APPROACH - VIA BACKGROUND PROMPT

Phase 1 – Analysis and Documentation Only

You are running as a Background Agent in the root of my Gyruss repository in VS Code.

The important folders are:
- `gyruss-html-js` → original HTML + JavaScript Gyruss game (works fairly well, some bugs remain)
- `gyruss-godot` → Godot port of the HTML/JS version (faster, but missing features and polish)
There is already a `copilot-instructions.md` file in the repo.

General rules for this phase:
- Phase 1 is **documentation and analysis only**. Do not change any game source code files (`.js`, `.gd`, scenes, assets etc.). Only create or update markdown / text documentation.
- Only use information that exists in this repo or that you can infer directly from the code and assets.
- Do not invent gameplay features, sprites, or effects that are not actually present. If you are unsure, say so explicitly in the docs.
- Work incrementally and keep file edits tidy and readable.

PHASE 1 TASKS

Step 1 – Scan and understand
1. Read `copilot-instructions.md` fully.
2. Scan the folder structure and key files in:
   - `gyruss-html-js` (especially entry-point HTML, main JS files, entities, audio, input handling)
   - `gyruss-godot` (main scenes, scripts, player/enemy logic, project configuration)
3. Build a mental model of how each version of the game is structured.

Step 2 – Update `copilot-instructions.md`
4. Update `copilot-instructions.md` so that it:
   - Clearly explains that there are two separate codebases: `gyruss-html-js` and `gyruss-godot`.
   - For each codebase, documents:
     - Purpose
     - Main entry points
     - Where the main game loop lives
     - Where entities, audio, input, and configuration are defined
   - Adds guidance for future Copilot sessions on how to decide which codebase to work with based on the user’s request.
   - References the documentation files you will create below (you can leave placeholder bullet points and then come back to update them once the docs exist).

Step 3 – Create a root `README.md`
5. At the repository root, create `README.md` (or update it if it already exists) with:
   - An overview of the Gyruss project and its purpose.
   - A clear description of the two sub-projects: `gyruss-html-js` and `gyruss-godot`.
   - Instructions for running the HTML/JS version, including:
     - Using VS Code Live Server or a simple static HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server PORT`) to serve the `gyruss-html-js` version.
     - Which HTML file to open, and any specific steps needed.
   - Instructions for running the Godot version, including:
     - Which version of Godot the project expects (infer from project files if possible; if unsure, give a reasonable range and mark as “verify”).
     - How to open the project in Godot.
     - How to run the main scene.
   - Links to the per-project docs you will create (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`, `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`, `design.md`).

Step 4 – Per-project documentation files
6. For **each** of `gyruss-html-js` and `gyruss-godot`, create these files inside the respective folder:
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`
   - `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`

7. Content expectations for each file:
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
     - Describe modules, major scripts, and scenes.
     - Explain where the main game loop lives and how it calls update / draw or equivalent.
     - Describe the entity system (player, enemies, bullets, missiles, power ups, bosses).
     - Describe how collisions, audio, and configuration are wired together.
   - `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`:
     - Summarise the goals of this implementation.
     - Describe current status and known limitations.
     - Note any major differences from the other implementation at a high level.
   - `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`:
     - Describe existing conventions: naming, file layout, module boundaries, how entities are added, how utilities are used, etc.
     - Add recommended practices for new code to stay consistent with what is already there.
   - Ensure all descriptions are grounded in the actual code. If something appears inconsistent or unclear, describe that uncertainty rather than guessing.

Step 5 – Per-project design documents
8. In `gyruss-html-js`, create a `design.md` file.
9. In `gyruss-godot`, create a `design.md` file.
10. For each `design.md`, provide a detailed description of how the game works in that implementation, including:
    - UI layout and visible elements.
    - Controls and input mapping.
    - Player ship behaviour (movement, firing, damage, lives etc.).
    - Enemy spawning, movement patterns, and any wave or level structure you can infer.
    - Bullets, missiles, and power-ups (types, behaviour, timing).
    - Bosses or special scenes if present.
    - Audio and visual effects (explosions, particle effects, screen shake, lighting, etc.).
    - Any special scoring, extra lives, or other gameplay rules.
    - For anything that is incomplete or stubbed out, document it as “partial / incomplete” rather than inventing full behaviour.

Step 6 – Differences between implementations
11. Compare the two `design.md` documents you just created.
12. At the repository root, create `differences.md` that:
    - Lists all features, behaviours, and aesthetic details that exist in `gyruss-html-js` but are missing or degraded in `gyruss-godot`.
    - For each entry, briefly classify the likely difficulty of porting it to Godot as one of:
      - “Easy” (local, self-contained changes)
      - “Moderate” (requires touching several scripts or scenes)
      - “Hard” (architecture-level changes or unclear mapping).
    - Group items sensibly (controls, player behaviour, enemies, effects, audio, UI, etc.).

Step 7 – Final update to `copilot-instructions.md`
13. Re-open `copilot-instructions.md` and update it again so that:
    - It references the new documentation files for each codebase:
      - `gyruss-html-js/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`, `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`, `design.md`
      - `gyruss-godot/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`, `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`, `design.md`
      - root `README.md` and `differences.md`
    - It gives clear guidance to future Copilot sessions:
      - When a request is about HTML/JS, which docs to consult first.
      - When a request is about Godot, which docs to consult first.
      - When to refer to `differences.md` for feature parity work.

Step 8 – Summary of changes
14. When all the above steps are done, post a summary in chat that lists:
    - All files you created.
    - All files you modified.
    - Any significant uncertainties or TODOs that a human should review.
15. Do not modify any game source code files in this phase; this phase is documentation and analysis only.


_____________________________________________________

Phase 2 – Implement Missing Features in Godot Version

Run this only after you are happy with the docs from Phase 1 and have committed them to git.

You are running as a Background Agent in the root of my Gyruss repository in VS Code.

We now move to PHASE 2: implementing missing features and polish in the Godot version based on the analysis and docs produced in Phase 1.

Important context files you should use:
- `copilot-instructions.md`
- Root `README.md`
- Root `differences.md`
- `gyruss-html-js/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`, `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`, `design.md`
- `gyruss-godot/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`, `CODING-GUIDELINES.md`, `design.md`

General rules for Phase 2:
- The **HTML/JS implementation is the reference**. The goal is to bring `gyruss-godot` closer to feature and aesthetic parity with `gyruss-html-js`.
- Only modify files under `gyruss-godot` (and update its markdown docs when needed). Do not change any files in `gyruss-html-js` in this phase.
- When in doubt about behaviour, prefer what is actually coded in `gyruss-html-js` over guesswork.
- Work in clear, logical chunks and keep changes cohesive. At sensible checkpoints, summarise what you have changed so a human can review diffs.
- Do not invent completely new features beyond what exists in the HTML/JS version.

PHASE 2 TASKS

Step 1 – Build a task plan from `differences.md`
1. Read `differences.md` carefully.
2. Group the differences into a task list with categories such as:
   - Controls and input
   - Player movement and firing
   - Enemy patterns and waves
   - Bullets, missiles, power-ups
   - Bosses and special sequences
   - Visual effects and particles
   - Audio (music, sfx, mixing)
   - UI and HUD
3. Within each category, order tasks from easiest to hardest based on your earlier classification (Easy → Moderate → Hard).
4. Create or update a file `gyruss-godot/TASKS.md` that lists this task plan, with tick boxes or bullet points, so humans can see progress.

Step 2 – Implementation loop (repeat until major tasks are done)
For each iteration, follow this pattern:

5. Pick a **small group of related differences** from `differences.md` and `TASKS.md` (for example, all “Easy” items in “Controls and input”).
6. For each chosen difference:
   a. Inspect the relevant code in `gyruss-html-js` to understand the correct behaviour.  
   b. Inspect the corresponding code and scenes in `gyruss-godot`.  
   c. Plan the minimal code and scene changes required to bring Godot behaviour closer to the HTML/JS behaviour without breaking other systems.
7. Implement the changes in `gyruss-godot` only. This may involve:
   - Editing Godot scripts (`.gd` files).
   - Adjusting node properties or scene references (as text where possible).
   - Tweaking constants, speeds, timings, spawn patterns, or effect parameters.
8. Where appropriate, update:
   - `gyruss-godot/ARCHITECTURE.md` if the structure changes.
   - `gyruss-godot/CODING-GUIDELINES.md` if new conventions are introduced.
   - `gyruss-godot/design.md` to keep the design description in sync with the new behaviour.
9. After finishing a logical group of changes, update `gyruss-godot/TASKS.md` and, where relevant, mark items in `differences.md` as partially or fully addressed (do not delete them; annotate their status).
10. In chat, provide a concise summary:
    - Which differences you addressed.
    - Which files you edited.
    - Any assumptions you had to make.
    - Anything that still needs human playtesting or visual tuning.

Step 3 – Safety checks and consistency
11. Whenever you make changes that might affect controls, main loops, or core gameplay, re-check:
    - That the main scene still references the correct scripts.
    - That no critical signals or node paths were broken.
    - That the game should still start successfully in Godot (you cannot run it here, but you can inspect obvious wiring).
12. Preserve performance characteristics that are already good in the Godot version. Only adjust what is necessary to match behaviour and aesthetics.

Step 4 – Gradual progress on harder tasks
13. After covering easier tasks, move on to moderate and hard items from `differences.md`, following the same pattern:
    - Study HTML/JS behaviour.
    - Study current Godot implementation.
    - Plan minimalist but coherent changes.
    - Update code, scenes, and docs.
    - Summarise progress and update `TASKS.md` and `differences.md`.

Step 5 – Final report
14. When you reach a reasonable stopping point (for example, most “Easy” and “Moderate” tasks complete, or you hit a structural limitation that needs human design input), produce a final summary in chat:
    - High level list of features now aligned between HTML/JS and Godot.
    - Remaining gaps and why they are non-trivial.
    - Pointers to key files to review in a git diff.
15. Do not erase or overwrite `differences.md`; keep it as a living record of what has and has not been ported.

Throughout Phase 2, keep your edits scoped, respect the existing project structure and conventions, and avoid speculative redesigns. The goal is pragmatic feature parity, not a total rewrite.
